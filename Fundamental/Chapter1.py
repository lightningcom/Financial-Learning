**If your inspection reveals the house is solid and generates high income, but is listed for only USD400k, Fundamental Analysis tells you it is undervalued—a bargain. Conversely, if the foundation is cracking but the listing price is USD 800k, it is overvalued, regardless of how popular the neighborhood is.**
