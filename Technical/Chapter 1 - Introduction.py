st.markdown("""
Have you ever looked at a stock chart—that jagged line zigzagging across a screen—and felt like you were trying to read an alien language? Or maybe you’ve watched financial news where pundits talk about "support levels," "breakouts," and "dead cat bounces" and wondered if they were just making it up as they went along? \n

**If so, you are in the exact right place.** \n
Welcome to the world of **Technical Analysis**. \n
First, take a deep breath and relax. While the financial industry loves to use complicated jargon to sound smart, the concepts we are going to learn in this book are actually based on something very simple: Human Nature. \n
Technical Analysis (TA) isn't magic. It isn't a crystal ball that predicts the future with 100% accuracy. Think of it more like weather forecasting. A meteorologist looks at the clouds, the wind speed, and the humidity to tell you, **"It’s probably going to rain this afternoon, so bring an umbrella."** \n  
Technical Analysts do the exact same thing. We look at the "clouds" of the market (price patterns) and the "wind" (volume) to say, **"The price is probably going up, so it's a good time to buy."** \n

st.subheader("So, What is Technical Analysis?", divider=True)
st.write("In the strictest textbook definition, **Technical Analysis is a method of analyzing financial markets by using charts, indicators, and other tools to identify patterns and make predictions about future price movements. It is based on the idea that the price of a security reflects all available information, including market sentiment, economic indicators, and  other factors.**")  

st.success("But here is the friendly definition: **Technical Analysis is the study of mass psychology.**")

st.markdown("""
Every single time a trade happens on the stock market (or crypto, or forex), it represents a transaction between two people: a buyer and a seller.
* **The buyer** thinks the price is **going up (Greed/Optimism)**.
* **The seller** thinks the price is **going down (Fear/Desperation)**. \n
The price on the chart is simply the meeting point of those two emotions. When you look at a chart, you aren't just looking at numbers; you are looking at a visual representation of human fear and greed fighting it out in real-time. \n
The Technical Analyst believes that by studying the **"footprints"** left by these buyers and sellers, we can figure out who is winning the war.

***Well! Before we embark with our TA journey, it's good to know the upcoming readings are based on the book by John J Murpy - Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets, because it's the holy grail of TA books.***
